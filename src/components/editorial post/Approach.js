                        A little story I first started design in 2015, at that time design that I fielded was more into vector art which was 
                        more intended for gifts to others. Initially I made the design just for fun, there was a friend who asked me to make it.
                        Until finally I realized that it could be a profitable business for me hehe. As of 2015 to 2019 I have done a lot of design
                        projects ranging from non-benefits to really bringing profit. Various types of designs have also been done by me. 
                        Vector art, product design, advertising, design for events, untill now I focus on design in the UI / UX field. Now that's a
                        little story, yet I started my career as a designer. But many people ask me "how do I start learning design until I dare
                        to take a project like that?". "Are there any special steps?" Actually there are no special steps for me. But I always try
                        to apply these steps evey time I design.

                        When I want to start working on a design I usually look for references first. This reference is very important to use so
                        that we have a picture of the design we are going to make later, so we don't spen too long to make the design parts
                        because at the beginning we already have the reference. But remember everything that is excessive is also not good, 
                        just like a reference. Too many references will also make us confused about what kind of design. 2 to 3 references are 
                        also enough how to help you in designing. We are certainly familiar with the term ATM. Yes, Observe, Iimitate and 
                        Modify. When I was still studying design and didn't dare to take project, I often did the ATM concept and even 
                        imitated it 100% haha. But I didn't publish it, aka I save it myself as study material. Over time, I began to believe in 
                        myself and dare to start working on projects from clients. Still using ATM concept a little bit, but not imitate 100%
                        yes because tis is commercial. Moreover, you must provide a high level of originality for the project from the client
                        that you are working on :D
